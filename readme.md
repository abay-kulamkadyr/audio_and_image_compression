### Description of the project 

* Lossless Audio Compression: the program compresses wav files using DPCM and mid/side encoding and passes it further to Java's Deflater library. 

* Lossy Image Compression: compresses a BMP image by transforming it into the DCT frequency domain and quantizing using a quantization table. 

* To get a complete description of the used algorithms, please refer to Report.pdf 

### Technologies used in this project
* IntelliJ IDE
